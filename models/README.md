# Placeholder for YOLO model

# Put your best.onnx model file here

# If you don't have the YOLO model, the code will continue to work

# but YOLO detection features will be disabled

# To get a YOLO model:

# 1. Train your own YOLO model for traffic sign detection

# 2. Convert to ONNX format

# 3. Place the best.onnx file in this directory

# Classes expected by the code:

# ['F', 'L', 'NF', 'NL', 'NR', 'R', 'math']

# Where:

# - F: Forward

# - L: Left

# - R: Right

# - NF: No Forward

# - NL: No Left

# - NR: No Right

# - math: Math problem sign
