echo "=== Solutions Created ==="
echo ""
echo "📄 Files created:"
echo "✅ ros_lidar_follower_fixed.py - Fixed version with error handling"
echo "✅ mock_yolo.py - Mock YOLO detector for testing"
echo "✅ mock_camera_publisher.py - Mock camera publisher"
echo "✅ models/best.onnx - Dummy model file"
echo ""

echo "🚀 How to test the fixed version:"
echo ""
echo "Terminal 1 - Start ROS core:"
echo "  roscore"
echo ""
echo "Terminal 2 - Start RPLIDAR:"
echo "  roslaunch jetbot jetbot_rplidar_a1.launch"
echo ""
echo "Terminal 3 - Start mock camera (optional):"
echo "  python3 mock_camera_publisher.py"
echo ""
echo "Terminal 4 - Run fixed follower:"
echo "  python3 ros_lidar_follower_fixed.py"
echo ""

echo "🔧 Key fixes applied:"
echo "✅ Mock YOLO detector when real model unavailable"
echo "✅ Handle missing camera topics gracefully"
echo "✅ Skip MQTT connection errors"
echo "✅ Fallback navigation system"
echo "✅ Better error handling and logging"
echo ""

echo "📊 Expected behavior:"
echo "• LIDAR-based obstacle avoidance will work"
echo "• Robot will move forward and avoid obstacles"
echo "• Warnings about missing camera are normal"
echo "• YOLO detection will be mocked (empty results)"
echo ""

echo "To run original file with less errors, you can:"
echo "1. Install missing camera drivers"
echo "2. Set up MQTT broker" 
echo "3. Train/download actual YOLO model"
echo ""
echo "But the fixed version should work with just LIDAR!"
